# RJ: HKOI

My submissions for practice problems on the competitive programming online judge, HKOJ (judge.hkoi.org). Submissions circa 2018-2024. 
The online judge is only available for subscribers and problems are not normally public. The online judge is designed for competitive programming / Olympiad in Informatics contestants in Hong Kong (see https://hkoi.org/en/). The online judge includes many past problems from notable contests, including the Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics (HKOI) and the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).

*Please note*: Do **not** learn from or make assumptions about my coding style from these files. Please do remember that they are for competitive programming and **not** software development, and that the goal is always to have fast code and write code quickly rather to have readable code that multiple people can work on together. Yes, my habits did allow me to code extremely quickly (see: typedef long long _;)
